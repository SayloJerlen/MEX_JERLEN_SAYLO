1. What is the difference of state and props. 

State and props has vast difference from each other due to their nature. Though the two are both plain JS object, can contain default values and are read-only when
they are used by this. States and props are used for contrasting purposes. For instance, state is a structure that could be updated to keep data and information
which could change as the time goes by. This "change" could occur as a response to a user's action or system event. One might also call state as the heart of the react
component wherein it decides how the component will render and behave. It must not be complicated and can be accessed or modified from the inside of component 
or direclty by it (mutable). Lastly, it can be modified using this.setState.

On the other hand, props are some form of an uneditable file; has a read-only components just like a PDF would be if not converted into a word file. It is an object used
for storing value of attributes of a tag and has similarities with the HTML attributes. It allows data passage from one component to another. It is considered immutable,
meaning, it could not be modified from the inside of component.
